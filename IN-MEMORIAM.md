The people mentioned here have been contributors to the various stages of
the development of the Raku Programming Language, but unfortunately have
departed this existence.  We thank them for their contributions and hope
to keep their memory alive here, as well as other places.

Jonathan Scott Duff (perlpilot)
-------------------------------
In the early days of the Rakudo implementation, Jonathan Scott Duff
implemented many of the NQP and Raku features that we take for granted
now.  In later years, he kept a very observant eye on developments in
the Rakudo and NQP code.

Jeff Goff (DrForr)
------------------
Ever since Jeff Goff got involved in the Perl community, he could be
found helping people. He was very active at events and conferences:
giving presentations, volunteering, and gaming with other attendees.

He also supported development as a release manager for the Parrot project.
Many have benefitted from his online presence, always ready to
help and answer questions.

He died in March 2020 in a snorkelling accident.
