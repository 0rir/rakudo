# Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler, Development Release #94 (“коледа”)

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I’m proud to announce the
Christmas release (December 2015) of Rakudo Perl 6 #94 “коледа”. Rakudo
is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Moar Virtual Machine[^1] and the
Java Virtual Machine.

This is the Christmas release of Rakudo Perl 6. This version of the compiler
targets the v6.c “Christmas” specification of the Perl 6 language. The
Perl 6 community has been working toward this release over the last 15 years.

The tag for this release is “коледа”, a slavic word for an ancient winter
festival that has been incorporated into Christmas. We hope you join us
in our celebration of getting our Christmas release shipped!

While we are extremely happy to ship an official Perl 6 release, this is not
the end of Rakudo’s development. We will continue to ship monthly releases,
which will continue to improve performance and our user’s experience. We’ll
also continue our work on the specification, with feedback from the community.

The tarball for this release is available from <http://rakudo.org/downloads/rakudo/>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star
distribution[^2] --- it’s announcing a new release of the compiler
only. For the latest Rakudo Star release, see
<http://rakudo.org/downloads/star/>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each
release named after a Perl Mongers group. This month’s release is named after
the Bend chapter, because we’re nearly around the bend with the upcoming
Christmas release.

Some of the changes in this release are outlined below:

New in 2015.12:
   + Christmas!

These are only some of the changes in this release. For a more
detailed list, see “docs/ChangeLog”.

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on
the design docs, the Perl 6 test suite, MoarVM and the specification.
Additionally, the Pugs, Parrot, and Niecza projects were all instrumental
with their contributions to the specification and the community.

The following people contributed to the development of the Christmas
release; We’ve gone back through the logs of all the various projects.
Thanks to everyone who has worked to make this release happen over the
past 15 years.

[^2]: What’s the difference between the Rakudo compiler and the Rakudo
Star distribution?

The Rakudo compiler is a compiler for the Perl 6 language.
Not much more.

The Rakudo Star distribution is the Rakudo compiler plus a selection
of useful Perl 6 modules, a module installer, the most recent
incarnation of the “Using Perl 6” book, and other software that can
be used with the Rakudo compiler to enhance its utility. Rakudo Star
is meant for early adopters who wish to explore what’s possible with
Rakudo Perl 6 and provide feedback on what works, what doesn’t, and
what else they would like to see included in the distribution.
