    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 compiler development release #44 ("CodeName")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm happy to announce the
September 2011 release of Rakudo Perl #44 "CodeName".  Rakudo is an 
implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine (see 
<http://www.parrot.org>). The tarball for this release
is available from <http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads>.

Please note: This announcement is not for the Rakudo Star distribution --
it's announcing a new release of the compiler only.  For the latest
Rakudo Star release, see <http://github.com/rakudo/star/downloads>.

The Rakudo Perl compiler follows a monthly release cycle, with each release
named after a Perl Mongers group. The September 2011 release is code named
after XXX

This release marks the transition to a different development branch called
"nom" (New Object Model).

Some of the specific changes and improvements occurring with this
release include:

* numerous speedups
* Int, Num and Str are now for more lightweight
* int/num as attributes are stored compactly in the object body
* meta objects are now much easier to modify
* much more robust handling of infinite list
* basic LoL (List of Lists) support
* :U and :D type modifiers
* protos and multis now conform to the new spec
* improved enum support
* basic 'constant' declarator
* .WHAT and friends as macros
* support for .gist
* run() has been renamed to shell() to conform to current spec
* hyper methods now descend into nested data structures
* basic safe mode (through --seting=SAFE)
* many bug fixes in parametric roles
* a custom BUILD does not suppress default values
* undeclared attributes detected and reported at compile time
* basic support for native int/num types on lexical variables
* a new regex engine

There are also a number of regressions, which we hope to fix in
the next release. Most notably the following features are not
yet implemented in the new regex engine, and thus not available to
the user:

* proto tokens 
* variable interpolation into regexes
* action methods

For a more detailed list of changes, see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible, as well as those people who worked on 
Parrot, the Perl 6 test suite and the specification.

The following people contributed to this release:

If you would like to contribute, see <http://rakudo.org/how-to-help>, ask on
the perl6-compiler@perl.org mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#45) is scheduled for October 20, 2011.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2011 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
