    Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 development release #29 ("Erlangen")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce the
May 2010 development release of Rakudo Perl #29 "Erlangen".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine
(see http://www.parrot.org).  The tarball for the May 2010 release
is available from http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads .

Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release named
after a Perl Mongers group.  The May 2010 release is code named
"Erlangen" in recognition of Erlangen.pm and the Perl 6 talk they had
Moritz Lenz, one of our core develepors, give this month.

Some of the specific changes and improvements occuring with this
release include:

[Note: next five are leftovers from Moscow. -colomon]
*  Expressions that begin with a variable and end with a circumfix now properly
   interpolate into double-quoted strings, like "@array.sort()" or
   "%hash<key>".

*  Item assignment now has tighter precdence than list assignment, so both
   'my @a = 1, 2, 3' and '$a = 1, $b = 2' magically work.

*  Most of the DateTime built-in type has been backported from the "alpha"
   branch, and is now accompanied by a Date type for date-only calculations.

*  Many obsolete uses of Perl 5 constructs are now caught and give helpful
   error messages.

*  As always, many additional small features and bug fixes make working with
   Rakudo more pleasant.

*  Rakudo now passes 32,347 spectests. We estimate that there are about
   39,500 tests in the test suite, so Rakudo passes about 82% of all tests.

For a more detailed list of changes see "docs/ChangeLog".

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible.  If you would like to contribute,
see http://rakudo.org/how-to-help , ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org
mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#30) is scheduled for June 17, 2010.
A list of the other planned release dates and code names for 2010 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
