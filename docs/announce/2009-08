Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 development release #20 ("PDX")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce
the August 2009 development release of Rakudo Perl #20 "PDX".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine [1].
The tarball for the August 2009 release is available from
http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads .

Due to the continued rapid pace of Rakudo development and the
frequent addition of new Perl 6 features and bugfixes, we continue
to recommend that people wanting to use or work with Rakudo obtain
the latest source directly from the main repository at github.
More details are available at http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo .

Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release code named
after a Perl Mongers group.  The August 2009 release is named "PDX",

In this release of Rakudo Perl, we re-worked the build process, enabling
us to build Rakudo against an installed parrot, and installing Rakudo itself.
There was also great progress in the area of user defined traits.

Some of the specific major changes and improvements in this release include:
  
* Rakudo is now passing 12,369 spectests, an increase of 493
  passing tests since the July 2009 release.  With this release
  Rakudo is now passing 82% of the available spectest suite.

* User defined traits can now be applied to classes and roles.

* The 'hides' trait on classes can make one class hide another

* Various operators that are not yet implemented give helpful error messages,
  instead of giving parse errors (which were sometimes much harder to
  understand).

Since the Perl 6 specification is still in flux, some deprecated features
will be removed from Rakudo. Prominently among those are:

 * '=$handle' is deprecated in favor of '$handle.get' (one line)
   and '$handle.lines' (all lines).

 * 'int $obj' is deprecated in favor of '$obj.Int'.

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible.  If you would like to contribute,
see http://rakudo.org/how-to-help , ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org
mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#21) is scheduled for September 17, 2009.
A list of the other planned release dates and codenames for 2009 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
