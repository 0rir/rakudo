Announce: Rakudo Perl 6 development release #24 ("Seoul")

On behalf of the Rakudo development team, I'm pleased to announce the
December 2009 development release of Rakudo Perl #24 "Seoul".
Rakudo is an implementation of Perl 6 on the Parrot Virtual Machine
(see http://www.parrot.org).  The tarball for the December 2009 release
is available from http://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/downloads

Due to the continued rapid pace of Rakudo development and the frequent
addition of new Perl 6 features and bugfixes, we recommend building Rakudo
from the latest source, available from the main repository at github.
More details are available at http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo.

Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release code named after
a Perl Mongers group.  The December 2009 release is code named "Seoul" for
Seoul.pm, who hosted Jonathan so well recently, and because they have a cake
duck.

Shortly after the October 2009 (#22) release, the Rakudo team began a new
branch of Rakudo development ("ng") that refactors the grammar to much more
closely align with STD.pm as well as update some core features that have been
difficult to achieve in the master branch [1, 2].  Most of our effort for the
past month has been in this new branch, but as of the release date the new
version had not sufficiently progressed to be the release copy.  We expect to
have the new version in place in the January 2010 release, but reserve the
right to release an interim release from this branch before then.

This release of Rakudo requires Parrot 1.9.0.  One must still
perform "make install" in the Rakudo directory before the "perl6"
executable will run anywhere other than the Rakudo build directory.
For the latest information on building and using Rakudo Perl, see the
readme file section titled "Building and invoking Rakudo".

Some of the specific changes and improvements occuring with this
release include:

* Rakudo is now passing # spectests, an increase of # passing
  tests since the November 2009 release.  With this release Rakudo is
  now passing % of the available spectest suite.

The development team thanks all of our contributors and sponsors for
making Rakudo Perl possible.  If you would like to contribute,
see http://rakudo.org/how-to-help , ask on the perl6-compiler@perl.org
mailing list, or ask on IRC #perl6 on freenode.

The next release of Rakudo (#25) is scheduled for January 21, 2010.
A list of the other planned release dates and codenames for 2010 is
available in the "docs/release_guide.pod" file.  In general, Rakudo
development releases are scheduled to occur two days after each
Parrot monthly release.  Parrot releases the third Tuesday of each month.

Have fun!
