This file contains various notes and observations Pm makes as
he reviews code.  Many of these can become RT tickets -- this is
just a lighter-weight mechanism for keeping track of things to be
reviewed/done.

Active notes

Pm-1:  In src/core/Array.pm, the exists() method has a line like:

        [?&] map { self[$^a] !~~ Proxy }, @indices;

There doesn't seem to be a strong reason for using C<map> and [?&]
here... more efficient would seem to be to use a slice directly, 
as in:

        none(self[@indices]) ~~ Proxy

Also, I'm fairly certain the test for Proxy won't stand, because
we'd like .exists() to also work on Lists.  In fact, any sort of
type-based test is likely wrong -- we'll probably have to resort
to some PIR-based testing here, since only PIR will really know if
an element is present in the List/Array.
