# Rakudo "nom" Branch Low Hanging Fruit

Want to help? Want something that (hopefully) doesn't require deep
guts skillz? Take a task from this list. Delete it from here when
you commit; maybe announce on #perl6 that you're working on it too.

Note - do not just copy stuff from the master setting! Often things
need to be done differently in the "nom" branch, to take advantage of
new possible performance.

## Complex
Add the Complex class and associated operators, very much like in master

## Rat operators
Add numeric operators for Rats, very much like in master
